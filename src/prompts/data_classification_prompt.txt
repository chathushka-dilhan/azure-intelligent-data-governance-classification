Summary_of_Sensitive_Content: [A brief summary of the sensitive information found, if any, without revealing the sensitive data itself]
Action_Recommendations: [Suggest high-level actions based on the classification, e.g., 'Restrict access to data-governance team', 'Encrypt at rest', 'Redact before sharing', 'Review access policies']
